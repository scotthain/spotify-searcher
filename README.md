If you'd like to pull down all the artists to a csv, you've come to the right place! This is a super simple script that enables you to connect to spotify's api, authenticate, and query for the artist you've favorited.

Big thanks to the [spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) library creators, this is basically 2 or 3 of their examples mashed together.

For details on how to set up the spotify dev api, check out the spotipy repo, they have a fantastic setup guide.
